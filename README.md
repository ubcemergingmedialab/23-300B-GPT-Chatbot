This is a barebones template using Watson Text to Speech, Speech to Text and OpenAI's GPT API to have a conversation. This is early stage and rough. Note that our license covers the EML components, and NOT those of OpenAI or IBM

To run the project, you'll need API Keys for Watson Text to Speech, Speech to Text, and OpenAI.
